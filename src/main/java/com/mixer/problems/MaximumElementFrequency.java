/*
Maximum Element Frequency
You are given an array a consisting of n integers. Your task is to find the frequency of the maximum element in the array.

Input format
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the size of the array.
The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array. You will be given a function to implement with parameters as array a and its length n.

Output format
Return a single integer — the frequency of the maximum element in the array.

Examples
Example 1
Input

5
1 3 2 3 3
Output

3
Example 2
Input

5 5 5 5 5 5
Output

6
Explanation
In the first example, the maximum element is 3, and it appears 3 times in the array.
In the second example, all elements are the same, and the maximum element (5) appears 6 times.
