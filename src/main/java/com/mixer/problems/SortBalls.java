/*
Sort Balls
Given an array arr with n balls numbered 0, 1, or 2, sort them in place so that balls of the same number are adjacent, with the numbers in the order 0, 1, and 2.

Note:-
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Input format:
n == arr.length
1 <= n <= 200
arr[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

Output format:
You do not need to return anything, sort them in place.

Examples
Example 1
Input: n=6 , arr = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2
Input: n=5 , nums = [2,0,1,1,1]
Output: [0,1,1,1,2]
