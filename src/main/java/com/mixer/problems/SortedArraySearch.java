Sorted Array Search
You are given a sorted array arr containing distinct integers. Your task is to implement a function search_position that, given a target value, returns the index where the target is found in the array. If the target is not present, return the index where it would be if inserted in order.

Note:-
Implement an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Input format:-
arr (1 <= len(nums) <= 10^4) is a sorted array of distinct integers.<br>
target (1 <= target <= 10^5) is the value to search for or insert.
Output format1 :-
Return an integer representing the index where the target is found or the index where it would be inserted.

Examples
Example 1
Input: arr = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2
Input: arr = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
